##### Uhhh, figure out how to run node-webkit for your system. A fleshed out readme will be available later (as well as binaries for Linux and Windows), when Aries hits 1.0. For now, you can download the node-webkit binary <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/node-webkit/mdfF9rS38oQ">for your system</a>, drop it in the root directory of this repo, and double-click on it.

Also, the (placeholder) app icon I'm using is "Floating Needle", one of the many awesome icons in Flarup's Safari icon set. I have a logo sketched out, so a proper Aries icon will come soon.
