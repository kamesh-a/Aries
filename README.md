##### Uhhh, figure out how to run node-webkit for your system. A fleshed out readme will be available later (as well as binaries for Linux and Windows), when Aries hits 1.0.

Also, the (placeholder) app icon I'm using is "Floating Needle", one of the many awesome icons in Flarup's Safari icon set. I have a logo sketched out, so a proper Aries icon will come soon.
